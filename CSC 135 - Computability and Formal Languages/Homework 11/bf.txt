Bf program reads two chars from stdin; adds their ASCII values; and
prints the char that results

,               # read first byte into data(0)
>,              # read second byte into data(1)
[               # while data(1) nonzero
    <+          # increment data(0)
    >-          # decrement data(1)
]
<.              # print data(0)
>++++++++++.    # increment data(1) from 0 to 10 (ASCII newline) and print it
